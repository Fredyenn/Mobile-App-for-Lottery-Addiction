# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction

The main purpose is telling people how hard it is to win a lottery and demolish their desired of buying lottery tickets. In order to do so, here we use a historical data coming from [the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset), which includes 3,665 drawings from 1982 to 2018.

Even the result of this project is fictional, the main idea is apply probability and data analysis to a real-world scenario.

## Outline of the project

This project is able to answer ---
- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three) winning numbers on a single ticket?
